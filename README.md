## Installing Haskell

### Use Stack to get GHC installed

Why?

As a new user you *will* run into package version conflicts that are way beyond your reasoning

"I used to tell people in my guide to install Haskell Platform, but I
stopped because it kept creating problems. Haskell Platform causes trouble
for new people when the globally installed packages get old. These very
same new people are the ones least equipped to cope with or understand the
problem or where it comes from."

  - Christopher Allen

How?

Install [Stack](http://haskellstack.org)
Quickstart Unix: `curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh`
